# Hello Storyteller,

thanks for helping us to re-imagine the Sint-Laurentius church and participating in our interactive research project on visual storytelling. 

The Sint-Laurentius church in Veltem gets reconverted. To reach a collaborative and supported function, the municipality launches the participatory trajectory ‘Dorp aan zet’ #buurthuisopkruissnelheid, where they invite residents, enthusiasts and interest groups to think along about the function of the St-Laurentius church. This interactive research project serves as a supplement to the participatory trajectory of the see-through churches.

In this project we invite residents to share their dreams about the church visually by drawing it on a frame to open a dialogue about the future of this place and community.
